    # Mother is standing on the skylift. She's near the edge furthest from the POV. She towers over the children, being more than twice the height of the tallest one.

    m "Welcome to the Skylift, children."

    m "Within this shaft lies the path to salvation."

    # Mother looks up. An image of what's at the top of the skylift appears: a single, tiny dot of light coming from a seemingly endlessly tall elevator shaft

    m "And this lift will take you there:"

    m "A place where a star shines bright and life frolics most naturally."

    m "It is known as The Surface."

    e "I know what the surface is. How do I get back home?"

    m "You will have to prove to me that you are ready..."

    m "... and that shall be achieved through your passing of scientific trials I have prepared for you."

    e "{i}Trials...?{/i}"

    m "Each one will test your mental, physical and emotional capabilities."

    m "Once completed, you will gain either a favorable or unfavorable analysis of your overall performance."

    # Mother steps off to the side and points an open hand to five blocks of concrete, each in ascending order: just like stairs. Small stone statuettes of the characters are on the ground beside it.

    m "This podium system represents my current evaluation of each and every one of you."

    m "Currently, it is neutral. But with every trial completed, you will be assigned three or five points, depending on the difficulty of the trial you have completed."

    m "I will update your evaluations every twelve hours, and you may come back here to check them at your leisure."

    m "Once seventy-two hours have passed, the kid with the most points will get to ride the Skylift."

    m "Everyone else will stay down here for the rest of their days."

    m "You will have no other chances to escape in the future. So make this one count."

    s "This is insane..."

    ru "When does the timer start ticking, Mother?"

    m "Once you have completed the *preliminary trial*."

    m "Unlike future trials, this one does not grant any points and must be completed by everyone."

    m "It is merely a sequence of questions I have prepared to test how well you retained your cognitive capabilities after your period of hydrostasis sleep."

    e "{i}I've been kidnapped to be tested on?{/i}"

    e "I-I'm not some kind of lab rat, you know?"

    e "I don't wanna do this."

    m "Eva, I am flattered. I did not expect you would be so fierce."

    m "If you would rather spend the rest of your days down here with me than participate in the trials, I can only be happy about it."

    e "Hnng..."

    e "..."

    e "How do we start?"

    # Mother looks disappointed by the answer

    m "I have brought three digital devices for you to complete the questionnaire."

    s "But there's five of us."

    m "I am afraid that you will have to complete it in pairs."

    m "Of course, the one who hasn't found a partner will have to do it by themselves."

    m "It should not be too much hassle, still. I have proofed the questions such that any regular ten year old would be able to complete them."

    s "I see."

    m "Here are the tablets."

    # Mother hands over the tablets to the group

    m "Come back to me once you have all decided how to split up."
