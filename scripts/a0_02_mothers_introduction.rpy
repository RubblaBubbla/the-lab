    u_re "It's René. Why are you making us do this?"

    re "I thought you were doing this as a test, but it sounds like you actually don't know our names. What's going on?"

    ru "Don't question her, René. She's the one in command here."

    u_m "It is alright. You have given your names, questions are not forbidden anymore."

    u_m "I should start by introducing myself."

    u_m "I am she who has created each and every one of you. During your gestation, I nurtured you and monitored your progress."

    re "Can I ask a question?"

    m "No. You already asked one."

    # René looks saddened.

    re "Oh. Ok."

    # Rene fades out.

    m "Next."

    # Rudy fades in.

    m "Yes."

    e "{i}I need to know something.{/i}"

    e "Can I please ask a question...?"

    m "Yes."

    e "Thank you. I just wanted to say that... I already do have a mom. Did you mean mother as in... an abbess?"

    m "No. That is not what I meant at all."

    m "I made you, Eva. You are my daughter."

    e "That's not true!"

    m "There is no need to shout, I can hear you."

    e "Okay, okay, sorry..."

    ru "What."

    re "I think she may have amnesia."

    ru "Oh lord... Things keep getting better and better, don't they?"

    e "That's not true, I haven't forgotten a single thing."

    ru "Then what was the last thing you did before stepping into the hydrostasis chamber?"

    e "What, you mean the glass tubes?"

    e "I haven't even seen them before!"

    ru "You *definitely* have amnesia."

    m "Children, you may want to continue your quarrel at a later time. Our time is not unlimited, and we still have much to say."

    # Rudy bows / looks apologetic

    ru "Sorry, Mother. I won't waste your time again."

    e "{i}My head is booming...{/i}"

    e "{i}What's happening to me? Who are these people?{/i}"

    e "{i}Am I really missing something?{/i}"

    m "Almost everyone has asked a question so far. Only Tau is missing."

    m "Do you have anything to ask?"

    t "Rayman seta! Is it really always half?!"

    m "Rayman... seta?"

    m "Ah. I understand."

    m "I may tell you later, the explanation is quite long-winded."
